# Simple Subscribe Form Built w/ Gulp + Bootstrap


All the tasks are done via Gulp. Webpack is just used for ES6 Import/Export as Gulp can't do it to my best of knowledge. Apart from ES6 Import/Export, Gulp was able to do all my other work that I wanted so I have mainly used Gulp. That being said, you can modify the webpack config to your preferences from `webpack` folder and use webpack specific plugins as you need.

For Live reloading, Browsersync has been used. For ES6 Transpilation, Babel has been used. For SourceMaps, Gulp & Webpack both have been used. For Icon Fonts, Font Awesome 5 has been used with Sass/CSS Workflow.
